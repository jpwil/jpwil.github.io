    <ul>
      <li>
        There are 3 main forms of leishmaniases: visceral (the most serious form
        because it is almost always fatal without treatment), cutaneous (the
        most common, usually causing skin ulcers), and mucocutaneous (affecting
        mouth, nose and throat).
      </li>
      <li>
        Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites which are transmitted by
        the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies.
      </li>
      <li>
        The disease affects some of the worldâ€™s poorest people and is associated
        with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune
        system and lack of financial resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        An estimated 700 000 to 1 million new cases occur annually. Only a small
        fraction of those infected by parasites causing leishmaniasis will
        eventually develop the disease.
